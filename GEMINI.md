# Gemini Suggestions for TabularTextMultimodalFusion (Updated)

This guide provides actionable steps to elevate your project's structure, reproducibility, and maintainability, turning it into a high-quality, installable Python package.

---

## 1. Refactor the Project into an Installable Package

This is the most critical step. Your `README.md` and goals point towards creating a distributable package. This requires a specific directory structure.

**Status:** **Not yet complete.** The `src` directory still contains a flat list of files.

**Actionable Steps:**

1.  **Create the Package Directory:** Inside `src/`, create a directory with your package name.
    ```bash
    mkdir src/tabulartextmultimodalfusion
    ```

2.  **Move Source Files:** Move all your Python source files from `src/` into the new `src/tabulartextmultimodalfusion/` directory.
    ```bash
    # Use git mv to preserve file history if you are in a git repository
    git mv src/*.py src/tabulartextmultimodalfusion/
    ```

3.  **Create Sub-packages:** Organize the code into logical subdirectories within `src/tabulartextmultimodalfusion/`. Add an empty `__init__.py` file to each directory to make it a recognizable Python module.
    ```bash
    # Create directories
    mkdir src/tabulartextmultimodalfusion/data
    mkdir src/tabulartextmultimodalfusion/models
    mkdir src/tabulartextmultimodalfusion/training
    mkdir src/tabulartextmultimodalfusion/tuning
    mkdir src/tabulartextmultimodalfusion/utils

    # Add __init__.py files
    touch src/tabulartextmultimodalfusion/__init__.py
    touch src/tabulartextmultimodalfusion/data/__init__.py
    # ...and so on for each new directory

    # Move files into their new homes
    git mv src/tabulartextmultimodalfusion/dataset.py src/tabulartextmultimodalfusion/data/
    git mv src/tabulartextmultimodalfusion/settings.py src/tabulartextmultimodalfusion/utils/
    git mv src/tabulartextmultimodalfusion/models.py src/tabulartextmultimodalfusion/models/ # etc.
    ```

4.  **Update `setup.py` for Pip Installation:** This is how you make your project installable via `pip`. Modify `setup.py` to find your package correctly.
    ```python
    from setuptools import setup, find_packages

    # Read dependencies from requirements.txt
    with open('requirements.txt') as f:
        required = f.read().splitlines()

    setup(
        name='tabulartextmultimodalfusion',
        version='0.1.0', # Use semantic versioning
        author='Your Name', # Add your name
        author_email='your.email@example.com', # Add your email
        description='A framework for multimodal fusion of tabular and text data.',
        long_description=open('README.md').read(),
        long_description_content_type='text/markdown',
        url='https://github.com/your-username/TabularTextMultimodalFusion', # Add your repo URL
        package_dir={'': 'src'}, # Specifies that packages are under the src directory
        packages=find_packages(where='src'), # Finds all packages under src
        install_requires=required, # Reads dependencies from requirements.txt
        classifiers=[
            'Programming Language :: Python :: 3',
            'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License',
            'Operating System :: OS Independent',
        ],
        python_requires='>=3.8',
    )
    ```

5.  **Install Locally:** After refactoring, you can test the installation:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
    This command installs your package in "editable" mode, so any changes you make to the source code are immediately reflected.

## 2. Implement Experiment Logging and Artifact Tracking

To ensure your research is reproducible and your results are properly tracked, you need to go beyond printing metrics to the console.

**Actionable Step:**

*   **Integrate an Experiment Tracking Tool:** Use a tool like **MLflow** or **Weights & Biases (W&B)** to log everything related to your experiments.

    **Why this is important:**
    *   **Logging:** Automatically save metrics (Accuracy, F1-score), parameters (model name, dataset), and other metadata.
    *   **Artifacts:** Save model checkpoints, configuration files, and even plots (like confusion matrices) for each run.
    *   **Comparison:** Easily compare results across dozens of experiments in a web-based UI.

    **Example with MLflow:**
    ```python
    import mlflow

    def run_experiment(config):
        # Start an MLflow run
        with mlflow.start_run(run_name=config['experiment_name']) as run:
            # Log parameters
            mlflow.log_params(config['model_params'])
            mlflow.log_param("dataset", config['dataset_name'])

            # ... your training loop ...

            # Log metrics
            mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy_score)
            mlflow.log_metric("f1_score", f1_score)

            # Log artifacts (like the model itself)
            mlflow.pytorch.log_model(model, "model")
            print(f"Run completed. See results in the MLflow UI. Run ID: {run.info.run_id}")

    # To view the UI, run `mlflow ui` in your terminal.
    ```

## 3. Externalize and Unify Experiment Configuration

As mentioned previously, moving experiment definitions out of Python scripts is crucial for reproducibility.

**Actionable Step:**

*   **Use YAML Configuration Files:** Define each experiment in a separate YAML file. This makes your code cleaner and your experiments easier to manage and share.

    **Example: `configs/exp2_encoders.yaml`**
    ```yaml
    experiment_name: "Numerical Encoder Comparison"
    base_model: "CrossAttentionConcat4"
    dataset: "wine_10"
    encoders: ["Fourier", "RBF", "Chebyshev"]
    # ... other parameters
    ```

    Your `main.py` becomes a simple entry point that parses the config and launches the experiment runner.

## 4. Implement a Comprehensive Test Suite

Testing is essential for a reliable package. With a clear model inventory, you can write targeted tests.

**Actionable Steps:**

1.  **Create a `tests/` directory.**
2.  **Write Model Tests:** For each model, ensure it can be initialized and can process a batch of dummy data.
3.  **Write Data Tests:** Test your `dataset.py` logic to ensure data is loaded and preprocessed correctly.
4.  **Set up CI:** Create a GitHub Actions workflow to run `pytest` automatically on every push or pull request. This catches bugs before they are merged.
