# TabularTextMultimodalFusion

A unified framework for experimenting with various architectures that combine **tabular data** (numerical + categorical) and **textual data** using pretrained language models (e.g., BERT/DistilBERT).  

Inspired by and extending the ideas in [TabularTextTransformer](https://github.com/yury-petyushin/TabularTextTransformer), this repo explores fusion architectures, contrastive learning, and graph-based methods for multimodal classification.

## üéØ Model Selection Guide

### Base Model Architectures

Choose from the following model families based on your use case:

#### üî• Cross-Attention Models (Recommended)
Our proposed approaches for optimal text-tabular fusion:
- **`CrossAttention`**: Core cross-attention mechanism between text and tabular features
- **`CrossAttentionSkipNet`**: Cross-attention enhanced with skip connections for better gradient flow

#### üîÑ Fusion-Based Models
Alternative fusion strategies:
- **`FusionSkipNet`**: Skip connections with feature fusion
- **`CombinedModelGAT`**: Graph Attention Network for combined feature processing

#### ü§ñ BERT-Based Approaches
Different strategies for incorporating BERT:
- **`LateFuseBERT`**: Late fusion of BERT text embeddings with tabular features
- **`AllTextBERT`**: Converts tabular data to text for unified BERT processing
- **`TabularForBert`**: Tabular data preprocessing optimized for BERT compatibility
- **`BertWithTabular`**: BERT with additional tabular feature processing layers

#### üìä Single-Modality Baselines
For comparison and ablation studies:
- **`OnlyTabular`**: Tabular data only (MLP-based)
- **`OnlyText`**: Text data only (BERT-based)

### Configuration Options

#### Fusion Methods
Control how text and tabular features are combined:

```python
# Without BERT self-attention on final embeddings
fusion_methods = ['Concat2', 'Concat4', 'SumW2', 'SumW4']

# With BERT self-attention on final embeddings (suffix 's')
fusion_methods = ['Concat2s', 'Concat4s', 'SumW2s', 'SumW4s']
```

- **Concat**: Concatenation fusion (2 = 2x dims, 4 = 4x dims)
- **SumW**: Weighted sum fusion (2 = 2x dims, 4 = 4x dims)
- **'s' suffix**: Applies BERT self-attention on final token embeddings

#### Numerical Encoders
Transform numerical tabular features for better cross-modal alignment:

- **`Fourier`**: Fourier feature encoding for periodic patterns
- **`FourierVec`**: Vectorized Fourier encoding
- **`PosEnVec`**: Positional encoding vectors
- **`RBF`**: Radial Basis Function encoding for non-linear relationships
- **`RBFVec`**: Vectorized RBF encoding
- **`Sigmoid`**: Sigmoid transformation for bounded features
- **`Chebyshev`**: Chebyshev polynomial encoding

#### Loss Functions
Optimize cross-modal representation learning:

- **`MMD`**: Maximum Mean Discrepancy for distribution alignment
- **`MINE`**: Mutual Information Neural Estimation
- **`InfoNCE`**: Info Noise Contrastive Estimation
- **`Contrastive`**: Standard contrastive learning loss

### Model Naming Convention

Models follow the pattern: `{BaseModel}{FusionMethod}[{NumericalEncoder}][{LossFunction}]`

**Examples:**
- `CrossAttentionConcat4`: Cross-attention with 4D concatenation fusion
- `CrossAttentionConcat4s`: Same as above but with self-attention on final embeddings  
- `CrossAttentionConcat4Fourier`: Cross-attention + Concat4 + Fourier encoding
- `CrossAttentionConcat4MMD`: Cross-attention + Concat4 + MMD loss

### üí° Quick Start Recommendations

| Use Case | Recommended Model | Why |
|----------|-------------------|-----|
| **Best Overall Performance** | `CrossAttentionConcat4s` | Optimal fusion with self-attention |
| **Limited Compute** | `CrossAttentionConcat2` | Smaller feature dimensions |
| **Periodic/Seasonal Data** | `CrossAttentionConcat4Fourier` | Fourier encoding for patterns |
| **High-Dimensional Tabular** | `CrossAttentionConcat4RBF` | RBF handles complex relationships |
| **Distribution Alignment** | `CrossAttentionConcat4MMD` | MMD loss for better alignment |
| **Baseline Comparison** | `OnlyText`, `OnlyTabular` | Single-modality benchmarks |

## üöÄ Running Experiments

### Quick Start

Run experiments using CLI arguments:

```bash
# Run experiment 1 (architecture comparison)
python main.py --version exp1

# Run experiment 2 (numerical encoders)
python main.py --version exp2

# Run experiment 3 (loss functions)
python main.py --version exp3
```

### Customization Options

#### 1. **Version Selection** (CLI)
Choose experiment type via command line:
```bash
python main.py --version exp1  # Architecture comparison
python main.py --version exp2  # Numerical encoder comparison  
python main.py --version exp3  # Loss function comparison
```

#### 2. **Dataset Selection** (Manual)
Edit `main.py` to customize datasets:
```python
DATASETS = ["wine_10", "airbnb", "kick"]  # Select from supported datasets
```

#### 3. **Model Selection** (Automatic by Version)
Models are automatically selected based on the version:
- **`exp1`**: Tests all architecture variants and baselines
- **`exp2`**: Tests numerical encoders with `CrossAttentionConcat4`
- **`exp3`**: Tests loss functions with `CrossAttentionConcat4`

Or manually override in `main.py`:
```python
if args.version == "exp1":
    MODELS = ["CrossAttentionConcat4s", "BertWithTabular"]  # Custom selection
```

### üß™ Experiment Types

| Version | Focus | Models Compared |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **`exp1`** | **Architecture Comparison** | All fusion architectures vs baselines |
| **`exp2`** | **Numerical Encoders** | Different encoders with best architecture |
| **`exp3`** | **Loss Functions** | Contrastive learning variants |

#### Experiment 1: Architecture Comparison
Tests fundamental fusion approaches:
```python
MODELS = [
    # Our proposed methods
    "CrossAttentionSumW4", "CrossAttentionConcat4", 
    "CrossAttentionConcat4s", "CrossAttentionSumW4s",
    # Alternative fusion
    "FusionSkipNet", "CombinedModelGAT",
    # BERT variants
    "BertWithTabular", "LateFuseBERT", "AllTextBERT",
    # Baselines
    "OnlyTabular", "OnlyText"
]
```

#### Experiment 2: Numerical Encoder Ablation

```python
MODELS = [
    "CrossAttentionConcat4Fourier", "CrossAttentionConcat4RBF",
    "CrossAttentionConcat4FourierVec", "CrossAttentionConcat4PosEnVec",
    "CrossAttentionConcat4Chebyshev", "CrossAttentionConcat4Sigmoid"
]
```

#### Experiment 3: Loss Function Comparison

```python
MODELS = [
    "CrossAttentionConcat4MMD", "CrossAttentionConcat4MINE",
    "CrossAttentionConcat4InfoNCE", "CrossAttentionConcat4Contrastive"
]
```

## üì¶ Installation

This project uses a two-step installation process to ensure that all dependencies and the correct Python version are set up correctly. First, you create a dedicated environment using `conda`, and then you install the package into that environment using `pip`.

### Step 1: Create the Conda Environment

This command uses the `environment.yaml` file to create a new conda environment named `TTMF` with all the necessary base packages, including the correct Python version.

```bash
# Create the conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yaml

# Activate the newly created environment
conda activate TTMF
```

### Step 2: Install the Package (Editable Mode)

Once the environment is active, install the `TabularTextMultimodalFusion` package in "editable" mode. This is the recommended approach for development, as any changes you make to the source code will be immediately available without needing to reinstall.

The `setup.py` file manages this process, using `requirements.txt` for additional `pip`-based dependencies.

```bash
# Install the package in editable mode
pip install -e .
```

Now your environment is fully set up and ready for running experiments.
